## corazon
This project is the development of my first website, created with django. I'm learning to code while doing this, 
so be aware that the stucture and code might not be high quality or bugfree. 

Currently (2015/10) the site provides a basic blog, a comment page and the basic design.

### motivation
This repository serves primary as a back-up. Still feel free to partake.

### installation
You need to add and adjust the settings.py file by including the app "blog" and your database settings.

Prerequisites are mentioned in requirements.txt
